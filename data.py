Chess Neural Network Competition - Data Generation

This script downloads and processes chess game data from Lichess,
filtering for high-rated games (2200+ Elo) to create training data.

TRAINING DATA FORMAT:
The output file (data/train.npz) contains:
- X: Board state features (numpy array of shape [n_positions, 768])
  - Each position is encoded as a 768-dimensional vector (64 squares Ã— 12 piece types)
  - Piece types: [white pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king, black pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king]
  - Value is 1 if piece is present, 0 otherwise

- y_move: Next move in UCI format (list of strings)
  - Example: "e2e4", "g1f3", etc.
  - These need to be encoded to numerical format for neural network training

- y_value: Game outcome from current player's perspective (numpy array)
  - +1: Current player wins
  - 0: Draw
  - -1: Current player loses

The data includes positions from all game phases (opening, middlegame, endgame)
from games where both players are rated 2200+ Elo.

# Note: The current board encoding is simple and can be improved.
# More sophisticated encodings might include:
# - Bitboards for each piece type
# - En passant squares
# - Castling rights
# - Move count / 50-move rule counter
# - Side to move
# - Previous board positions (for detecting repetitions)
# - Legal move mask
#
# The move encoding (currently just UCI strings) should be converted to:
# - One-hot encoding over all possible moves (4096 dimensions)
# - Or piece-centric encoding (from_square + to_square + promotion)
#
# For serious neural network training, consider using existing
# chess ML libraries like python-chess-nn or leela-chess encodings.
